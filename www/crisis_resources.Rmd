### **I Feel Suicidal**

<p style = "color: #08aca4; font-size: 13pt"><u>If you are thinking that you might be better off dead, thinking of hurting yourself or attempting suicide, please consider talking to someone. </u></p>

<p style = "color: white;background-color: #487494;padding: 10px;font-family: Verdana;font-size: 11.5pt">
You may feel that your life will never get better and life is not worth living.    
You may feel lonely, no one cares about you, or no one is able to reach you at where you are.     
Or you may be feeling something entirely different. It is ok to have these feelings and sometimes it makes you feel clearer when you talk to someone.    
Though few people would be able to understand what you are going through, they want to listen to you and look into the abyss with you.    
Please give them a chance. Your story is important. 
</p>

Depending on what you are comfortable with, below are a few options for you to talk to someone.

### **I Want to Help Someone**

It is important and sometimes scary to help someone who is suffering internally. While emergency services can save lives, they can also lead to further traumatization in some cases. Before you take someone to the hospital, report their suicidal thoughts to the authority, or call emergency services on their behalf, please consider the potential consequences outlined below. 

#### <u>**Why Approach Matters**</u>

**Why do we care about the approach (active vs. no active rescue) these hotlines take?**   
<font size = "2.8">(some adapted from this [Twitter thread by Dr. Emily Krebs](https://twitter.com/SaltySicky/status/1568751393086783494))</font>

* People experience suicidal thoughts differently. A person may suddenly become suicidal following a recent event, or they can be chronically suicidal, meaning that they always consider suicide as an option at the back of their mind.

* Being suicidal does not mean that a person will carry out suicidal behaviors or need to be immediately hospitalized. Yes, hearing that a loved one is thinking about suicide can be incredibly scary, but calling emergency services on them may not be the most helpful approach.   

* Reporting someone for being suicidal can get them [kicked out of college](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/11/yale-suicides-mental-health-withdrawals/), [fired from jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vsw4b/update_to_just_got_fired_for_being_suicidal/), and sometimes even [lose custody of their kids](https://farzadlaw.com/can-a-suicidal-parent-lose-custody). **Mandatory reporting policies are dangerous & are aimed at protecting businesses and organizations from liability, not helping people.**   

* The UN has called involuntary psychiatric care a form of torture but it's still regularly practiced on suicidal patients in the US. Involuntary 72-hour ("5150") holds are the norm for people deemed a threat to themselves. 5150 holds are one of the only legal circumstances in the USA where people can be forced to undergo medical treatments and ingest food or liquids against their will. 

* Suicide risk following involuntary psychiatric hospitalization skyrockets [$^1$](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31162700/) [$^2$](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710249/). While 5150 holds may prevent a person from dying in one moment of crisis, they don't protect people long term. 988 openly engages in *nonconsensual* active rescue despite its harms and lack of effectiveness. **Callers seeking phone support can end up being escorted by police to a psychiatric hospital against their will--sometimes at gunpoint if the officers deem the person dangerous.** Individual who belong to racial or gender minority groups or have disabilities face greater risk of being traumatized.   

* Text 401-400-2905 for urgent support with psychiatric incarceration/involuntary hospitalization
