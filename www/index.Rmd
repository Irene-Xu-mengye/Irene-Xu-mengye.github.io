<p style = "font-size: 21pt;font-weight: 540">About</p>  

<p style = "font-size: 13pt"> Thank you for visiting my website. I am Irene Xu [(pronunciation)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AHj1kS1B3E) and I use they/them [pronouns](https://www.pridetraining.org.au/pages/pronoun-page). I am an incoming PhD student in the Clinical Psychology Program at the University of Notre Dame. I work with Dr. Brooke Ammerman at the Affect, Suicide, Self-Injury, and Social Triggers [(ASSIST) Lab](https://assistlab.nd.edu/) and the Notre Dame Suicide Prevention Initiative - Research, Intervention, and Training ([SPIRIT](https://preventsuicide.nd.edu/)).
</p>

<p style = "font-size: 15pt;font-weight: 700">Research</p>  

<p style = "font-size: 13pt"> Some of the questions that my research tries to answer are: </p>
<ul>
  <li style = "font-size: 13pt"> Why do some individuals engage in suicidal behaviors while some others are able to stop themselves? 
  </li>
  <li style = "font-size: 13pt"> Does temporal dissociation serve a protective function that stop the transition from ideation to attempt? 
  </li>
  <li style = "font-size: 13pt"> What can we learn from the extremely high rate of SITB in the gender diverse population?
  </li>
</ul>

<p style = "font-size: 13pt">
To answer these questions, I employ a wide range of methods, including cross-sectional, longitudinal, and real-time monitoring study designs. Given the complex nature of SITBs, I am trying to develop a statistical expertise in analyzing a variety of data. See my recent projects [here](recent_work.html).
</p>

<p style = "font-size: 15pt;font-weight: 700">Community</p>  

<p style = "font-size: 13pt"> Coming from a non-majority background, I have been immensely grateful for all the support I have received that helped me get to my current career stage. I am committed to giving back to the community and uplifting underrepresented populations in the academic and clinical field. If you are applying for clinical psychology PhD programs, here are some [resources](app_resources.html) that I compiled. If you are looking for researchers whose primary research focus is suicide, here are some [resources](suicide_researchers.html) to get started. Feel free to reach out to me as well. </p>
