#### **Recruitment/Diversity Programs**    

Recruitment programs are amazing if you want to hear from faculty themselves. Most programs let you interact with faculty directly in breakout rooms, and some even have faculty provide feedback on your materials (e.g., Harvard PPREP). Definitely attend if you're interested in these particular programs! Also check out their websites for tips.

#### **Non-Profits/Student-Led Programs**    

Many of these programs offer one-to-one mentorship and/or have *phenomenal* resources pages. Personally I received TONS of help from my project SHORT mentor.  

* [Project SHORT](https://www.project-short.com/) matches applicants with mentors in a related field to provide one-to-one mentoring. "One of the goals of Project SHORT is to offer pro-bono mentoring for individuals from diverse and underrepresented populations in STEM." 
* [Application Statement Feedback Program (ASFP)](https://www.asfp.io): "Our goal is to provide fast, constructive feedback and editing support for the research/personal statements of PhD applicants in psychology, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities and/or those who are not ‘in the know.’"
* [Psychin'Out](https://www.psychinout.org/) has a [resource hub](https://www.drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1INKBbyDCCNqSPDMIqK8kpdLk9k8Pqyof) of application materials and slack channels for people with different background and are at different stages of their careers.
* [NextGen Psych Scholars Program (NPSP)](https://nextgenpsychscholars.com/) is a virtual graduate student-led mentorship program for underrepresented (e.g., BIPOC, low-income, first-gen, LGBTQIA+) undergraduates and post-baccalaureates interested in applying to psychology PhD programs.
* [Getting into Grad School](https://www.psychphdeat.com/resources) is a program for applicants who plan to apply for Clinical Psychology programs in the current cycle. They provide monthly meetings, feedback on application materials and interview practice.
