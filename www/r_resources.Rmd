```{r include=FALSE}
colorize <- function(x, color) {
  if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
    sprintf("\\textcolor{%s}{%s}", color, x)
  } else if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
    sprintf("<span style='color: %s;'>%s</span>", color,
      x)
  } else x

**For beginners who like to learn data analysis in R, here are some great resources**    

* [Swirl stats](https://swirlstats.com/) has an interactive course in R 
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a textbook style guide   
* Learning R [Resources](https://github.com/Joscelinrocha/Learning-R-Resources/wiki) (lots of resources linked here)

**Maximize Accessibility in Data Visualization**    

* Colors are a great way to capture attention. However, 5-8% men and 0.5-1% women experience color blindness. This [website](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) simulates what people with different kinds of color blindness see and shows how some existing colorblind-friendly palettes actually donâ€™t do a good job. 

* These are my personal favorite colorblind-friendly colors:   
  + `r colorize("#0C7BDC", "#0C7BDC")`
  + `r colorize("#FFC20A", "#FFC20A")`    
  + `r colorize("#7D2F39", "#7D2F39")`    
  + `r colorize("#FF6999", "#FF6999")`
