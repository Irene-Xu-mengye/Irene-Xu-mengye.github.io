#### **Free Resources On Learning R**
* There are many free resources out there about learning R and related languages, and the incredible database [**resouRces**](https://www.resourcesdatabase.com/resources/learning_r.html) literally has it all!

* [Psych #rstats Club](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cbOyYoR4CCb4zYvKy2dGgeuKfeRhyA5qS24EdYFHDQY/edit#gid=0) is a list of resources for using R in psychology.

#### **Multilevel Modeling (MLM)**
* [An Introduction to Hierarchical Modeling](http://mfviz.com/hierarchical-models/): a very nice animated visualization for understanding mixed-effects models
* [Understanding and analyzing multilevel data from real-time monitoring studies: An easily- accessible tutorial using R](https://psyarxiv.com/xf2pw/) by [Dr. Evan Kleiman](https://kleimanlab.org/)
* A comprehensive tutorial with sample code and data by Penn State: [Intensive Longitudinal Data: Analysis of Experience Sampling and EMA Data](https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/resources/intensive-longitudinal-data-analysis-experience-sampling-and-ema-data)

#### **Building a Website**

I built this website hosted on GitHub using R markdown. It comes with templates and is completely free. You don't need advanced programming knowledge to get started. [Learn to build your own here.](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)

#### **Data Visualization**

* [How to pick more beautiful colors for your data visualizations](https://www.resourcesdatabase.com/resources/visualization.html)
* Colors are a great way to capture attention. However, 5-8% men and 0.5-1% women experience color blindness. This [website](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) simulates what people with different kinds of color blindness see and shows how some existing colorblind-friendly palettes actually donâ€™t do a good job. 
* These are my personal favorite colorblind-friendly colors:   
  + `r colorize("#0C7BDC", "#0C7BDC")`
  + `r colorize("#FFC20A", "#FFC20A")`
  + `r colorize("#7D2F39", "#7D2F39")`
  + `r colorize("#FF6999", "#FF6999")`
