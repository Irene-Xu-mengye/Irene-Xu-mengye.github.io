#### **Get Started with R**    

* [Swirl stats](https://swirlstats.com/) has an interactive course in R 

* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a textbook style guide   

* Learning R [Resources](https://github.com/Joscelinrocha/Learning-R-Resources/wiki) (lots of resources linked here) 

<br>

#### **Multilevel Modeling (MLM)**

* [An Introduction to Hierarchical Modeling](http://mfviz.com/hierarchical-models/): a very nice animated visualization for understanding mixed-effects models   

* [Understanding and analyzing multilevel data from real-time monitoring studies: An easily- accessible tutorial using R](https://psyarxiv.com/xf2pw/) by [Dr. Evan Kleiman](https://kleimanlab.org/)   

* A comprehensive tutorial with sample code and data by Penn State: [Intensive Longitudinal Data: Analysis of Experience Sampling and EMA Data](https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/resources/intensive-longitudinal-data-analysis-experience-sampling-and-ema-data)

#### **Maximize Accessibility in Data Visualization**    

* Colors are a great way to capture attention. However, 5-8% men and 0.5-1% women experience color blindness. This [website](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) simulates what people with different kinds of color blindness see and shows how some existing colorblind-friendly palettes actually donâ€™t do a good job. 

* These are my personal favorite colorblind-friendly colors:   
  + `r colorize("#0C7BDC", "#0C7BDC")`
  + `r colorize("#FFC20A", "#FFC20A")`    
  + `r colorize("#7D2F39", "#7D2F39")`    
  + `r colorize("#FF6999", "#FF6999")`
